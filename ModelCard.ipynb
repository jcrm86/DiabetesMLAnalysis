    "\n",
    "Missing Values: For this data set no missing values were found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers: These were filtered for Age, BMI and Income. Rows were removed when the outlier was identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Scaling:  Current features are separate into boolean (1 or 0) and integer values on ranges between 0 to 100. A max-min algorithm was implemented to normalize variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations of Training Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Demographic Specificity: This investigation was done all around US.Ã±\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal Relevance: Data collected in 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Completeness: Lacks certain potentially relevant features like detailed dietary habits, physical activity levels, or genetic markers beyond the pedigree function, also relationship between education or income to a physical condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Evaluation Data**\n",

    "\n",
    "Data Size: it will be taken 30% of the total data\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation Methodology: The model was evaluated on a held-out test set that was not used during training or hyperparameter tuning. Performance metrics were calculated after applying the optimal classification threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Performance Metrics**\n",
    "Performance was evaluated using a combination of metrics crucial for medical classification, considering the potential imbalance in diabetes prevalence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy: \n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity (Recall): \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**6. Ethical Considerations & Bias**\n",
    "Potential Biases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Demographic Bias: As noted in training data limitations, the model's performance may degrade or exhibit bias when applied to populations outside the US population due to differences in genetic predisposition, environmental factors, or healthcare access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fairness: Continuous monitoring and re-evaluation of model performance across diverse demographic subgroups (if such data becomes available) is crucial to ensure equitable risk prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transparency: The model's predictions should always be presented with confidence scores and, ideally, with explanations (e.g., feature importance) to aid clinician understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsible Use: Emphasize that the model is a tool to assist, not replace, human medical professionals. All predictions must be reviewed and validated by a qualified clinician in the context of a patient's full medical history.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Limitations**\n",
    "Generalizability: The model's performance is optimized for the characteristics of the training data. Its applicability to diverse populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Scope: The model relies solely on the provided 23 features. It does not account for other potentially significant risk factors not present in the dataset (e.g., detailed diet, exercise habits, specific genetic markers not captured by DPF).\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Recommendations for Use**\n",
    "Clinical Context: Always use the model's output in conjunction with full clinical assessment, patient history, and other diagnostic tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Population Specificity: Exercise caution and validate thoroughly if applying the model to patient populations significantly different from the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring: Implement a robust system for monitoring the model's performance in real-world clinical settings to detect any performance degradation (model drift) over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback Loop: Establish a feedback mechanism from clinicians to continuously improve the model based on real-world outcomes and insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Updates: Plan for periodic model retraining and re-validation with new, diverse data to maintain its relevance and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
